# brick_breaker
It is my AI-based - the mini-project game is for learning purposes. It is my 4th-semester assignment while doing postgraduate studies in Computer Application at the University of Hyderabad. The Game consists of a set of Bricks that are needed to be broken, the purpose of the game is to complete all bricks breaking without losing the ball to the bottom of the screen, the game cannot be saved and loaded when tried to continue from where it is saved after even closed, here when the user breaks bricks then the user will get 5 points for each brick and if the user continuously breaks all the bricks then it will be the highest score and then the user will be the winner., if the user misses the ball to bounce on paddle the ball fall to the bottom of the screen then the user will lose his score and also he loses the game and then restart will be required.
